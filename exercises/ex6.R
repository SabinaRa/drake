# EXERCISE 6
#
# TASK: Test few `gam_k` parameter values
# - Use `map()` to parametrize targets affected
# - For simplicity, please remove report rendering
# 
# BONUS TASK: Try modifying the report (both `report.Rmd` and rendering function)
# to make it work with branching (HINT: `id_chr()` gives current target name)
